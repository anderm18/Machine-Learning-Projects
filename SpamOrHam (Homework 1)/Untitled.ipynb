Anyways, Logistic Regression is the best choice for solving this problem as it is a problem with binary solutions - Spam/Not Spam (or as some may say, Ham!). Using Linear Regression for this problem would not make much sense as we aren't trying to extrapolate a new value - like a stock prediction - we are instead trying to predict a Yes or No question."

You must provide a link to the dataset and perform necessary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Clearly demonstrate the steps you follow for your EDA with a justification of why these were required. For example, if the dataset has lot of missing values, then why did you use a specific technique when handling missing data.
